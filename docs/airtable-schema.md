OR(Status="Invited",Status="To Invite")
```

### Email lookups
```
{Email} = "user@example.com"
```

### Directory queries
```
AND({Show in directory}=TRUE(), {Status}="Joined")
```

### Events by host
```
AND(SEARCH("user_name", ARRAYJOIN({Hosted by}, ", ")), IS_AFTER({Start Date}, "2024-01-20"))

```
{Tier} != 'Staff'
```
